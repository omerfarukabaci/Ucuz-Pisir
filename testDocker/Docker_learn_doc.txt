Docker is a platfrom for developing, deploying and running
applications with containers.

Images and Containers:

    Container: Runtime instance of an image.
    Image: An executable package that includes everything needed.
        ex: codes, libraries, env variables, config files.

    command: 

    Container - Virtual machines:
        Difference:
            A container shares the kernel of the host machine.
            A vm runs a guest operating system.

Commands: 
    -(assume it's trun with sudo)

    docker ps
        -(ps: 'process status' in linux. )
        -lists running containers.
    
    #list docker Images
    docker image ls 

    #list docker containers
    docker container ls
        -lists running containers
    docker container ls --all
        -lists all containers

    docker run <tagname> //fix  this
        ex: sudo docker run -d -p 4000:80 testtag
            -p <int>:<int> parameter: //
                Remaps the ports <x> to <y>.
                We would see a message app is running at localhost:80,
                but that message comes inside of container.
                We mapped port 4000 to 80.
                So we can see the app is running at localhost:4000
            -d parameter: //
                runs the app on detached mode
                //read further later
        ex: docker run username/repository:tag 
            runs image from repository

    docker container stop <container_id>
        -Stops the container with <container id> that was running.

    docker build -t <tagname> .
        builds and image from the pwd's dockerfile and assigns the tag.

    docker login
        logins into hub.docker.com
        WARNING:
            stores the password as plain text file at
                /home/berkan/.docker/config.json.
    
    docker push <username>/<repo_name>
            uploads into hub.docker.com
    
    docker image rm <image_id>
        Remove specified image from this machine

Dockerfile:
    It builts into an image.

Sharing the image:
    We use 'docker push <>' to push into hub,
    and 'docker run <>' to pull //? needs confiramtion
